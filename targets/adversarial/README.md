# Adversarial Settings

This folder contains a collection of adversarial techniques to detect dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) tools. This is largely referenced *jitmenot* component of the [PwIN](https://github.com/zhechkoz/PwIN) project and artifacts from the [dbi-detector](https://github.com/dcdelia/dbi-detector) project.

## Taxonomy

The adversarial techniques are categorized into the following categories:
